The historic Albemarle County Courthouse is a jurisdictional island -- an area less than one square block that's part of Albemarle County, but entirely surrounded by the City of Charlottesville.

For 10,000 to 18,000 years, the land the Courthouse sits on was traveled through and lived in by people we now refer to as Ancestral Monacan Society. Around 1000 CE, the ancestors of the people who now call themselves the Monacan Indian Nation formed permanent settlements in the area, most notably the chiefly village of Monasukapanough, just north of present-day Charlottesville on the North Fork of the Rivanna River. In the early 18th Century, white Anglo-American incursion, frequently violent, forced the Monacans to abandon their numerous settlements in central and western Virginia. Many migrated away from central Virginia, but there has always been an appreciable population in more isolated areas. They still live here, with many now residing near Bear Mountain in Amherst County. 

The county of Albemarle was formed in 1761, and named for Willem van Keppel, 2nd Earl of Albemarle, a former governor of the colony of Virginia. Charlottesville was chartered the next year, in 1762, to serve as a centrally-located county seat, and named for Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who had the year before become Queen consort of Great Britain and Ireland after her marriage to George III.

The land for the Courthouse was donated by Dr. Thomas Walker to the County. The construction of the original wooden Courthouse building was contracted to William Cabell. Cabell was bonded by John Fry, John Moore, and John Lewis, but was unable to complete the building, and Moore finished overseeing construction.    375L cost? but bond says otherwise.

court square enclosed in 1792. 

In 1803, the original building was replaced by a Flemish bond brick structure topped by a cupola, which is now the right rear wing of the current building. The bricks were likely made on-site, as was the typical practice of the day. Given the reliance on enslaved labor during that time, it is likely that enslaved workers were significant contributors to the construction of the building.

In 1859 a front addition was constructed in the Gothic Revival style, with octagonal stair towers flanking the entrance. 

During the 1870’s, the portico, with its grand columns, was added, while as late as 

1938 a WPA project remodeled the building to create uniformity with the earlier classical style.
