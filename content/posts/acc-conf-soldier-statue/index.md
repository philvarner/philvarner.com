## Introduction

On May 5, 1909, the Confederate soldier memorial consisting of the statue "At The Ready" and two Napoleon cannons was dedicated in front of the Albemarle County Courthouse. This mail-order bronze statue depicts a soldier at ready, rifle raised, ready to kill to perpetuate the institution of slavery.
